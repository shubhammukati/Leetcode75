LeetCode 75 Challenge
Welcome to my journey of tackling the LeetCode 75 problems! Over the next month, I will be solving 75 carefully curated problems designed to enhance my coding skills and deepen my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

Objective
The goal of this challenge is to complete the 75 problems in a short time span, ideally within one month. This will help in reinforcing key concepts and improving problem-solving speed and accuracy.

Timeline
Start Date: 20 june 2024
End Date: lets see 
Structure
I will be following the LeetCode 75 list, which includes a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems. The problems are spread across various topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, dynamic programming, and more.

Problem List
1. Arrays & Hashing
2. Two Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Stack
5. Binary Search
6. Linked List
7. Trees
